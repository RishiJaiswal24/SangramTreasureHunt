                    Iron teeth guard the dawn of thought,
                    Forged in the year when empires fought.
                    Fifty-seven winters after the crossed mutiny’s flame.
                    I was raised to bear the scholar’s name.
                    Touch the numerals carved in rust & pride.
                    Count the strokes where digits hide.
                    The sum of their lines is the key you seek — whisper it low, it will speak.                </p>
            </div>
