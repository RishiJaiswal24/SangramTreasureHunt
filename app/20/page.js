                I am a silent spy in a chamber of minds,
                whose walls wear emerald like whispering winds.
                Across from the portal where comrades convene,
                I capture the chaos, the laughter unseen.

                Through my clear gaze, the world winks back at you —
                What am I, that frames both the old and the new?
            </div>
        </main>
