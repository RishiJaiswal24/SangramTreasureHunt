                    Stand where the campus turns its back,
                    Fifth sentinel from iron track,
                    Count leftward from the gate that never swings,
                    But mirage whispers: skip the one which is the number of primary colours.
                    Ignore the lie — count every word.
                    At my base, a shadow falls at dusk.
                    Trace the line where light meets husk.
                </p>
            </div>
