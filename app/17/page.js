                    I am the single knot beneath the plank,
                    a blind eye of tree that never learned to forget.
                    Between the clicks of keyboards & the hum of coils,
                    I drink the tremors of every heel, every foot,
                    a heartbeat of sap that maps the war between bit & spark.

                    Trace me with fingertip & the table will sigh;
                    What am I, the scar where physics & silicon collide?
                </p>
            </div>
        </main>
