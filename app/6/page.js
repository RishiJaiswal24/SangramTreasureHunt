                    Fragment Gate No. 1, Trial of the Threshold
                    At Gate No. 1, where the stone breathes morning, take ten measured paces toward the courtyard’s heart.
                    Rotate thirty-seven degrees to the left and walk five steps of faith.
                    Those who expect markings will find none; those who do not, will find…something unremarkable.
